# Recipe Book

Recipe Book is an online app designed to build a community of 'foodies' and home cooks who share recipes and join in conversations. All users have access to browse and view published recipes but users must be registered to interact with content, join conversations and submit their own recipes. Registered users can easily submit their recipes to the site via a recipe submission form and can return to edit their recipes or delete them from the site. Each recipe is displayed on the site for other users to access after the author has requested publishing and it has been accepted by admin. Recipes can also be saved to the 'My Recipe Book' section where registered users can access saved recipes more easily and also access recipes they have written.

## Agile Development

This project was developed using Agile methodology which allowed me to iteratively and incrementally build my app, with flexibility to make changes to my design throughout the entire development process.

GitHub Issues and Projects were used to manage the development process. Each part of the app is divided into Epics_ which are broken down into User Stories with Tasks. An Epic represents a large body of work, such as a feature. The board view of the Project feature was used to display and manage my progress in the form of a 'kanban board'. The user stories were added to the 'Todo' column to be prioritised for development, moved to the 'In Progress' column to indicate development of the feature had begun and finally moved to the 'Done' column when the feature had been implemented and the acceptance criteria had been met.

User stories were prioritised using the MoSCoW prioritisation technique. Each user story was given one of the following labels:

- Must have - to indicate the user story is guaranteed to be delivered.
- Should have - to indicate the user story would add significant value but is not vital.
- Could have - to indicate the user story would have a small impact if left out.
- Won't have - to indicate the user story is not a priority in the current iteration.

GitHub milestones were also used to group related user stories together.

## Design

### Structure

The Recipe Book app is designed with a simple structure to ensure the app is easy to use and navigate. Each page has a consistent layout to allow users to easily find the information they need. The app has a responsive design to ensure it can be clearly viewed on a wide range of devices. The navigation menu is available on all pages of the app to provide users with a consistent method to navigate the site.

### Colour Scheme

![colour palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

The colour scheme was chosen to complement the colours in the images without causing distraction and provide contrast for good readability of the information. The colour palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to add the following fonts:

- 'Roboto' was used to provide a simple, clean and easy to read appearance.
- 'Reenie Beanie' was used as a decorative font for the logo.

### Imagery

The images and logo were chosen to reflect the content site, and provide a simple appearance without causing distraction.

### Icons

Icons were used as visual indicators for social media links, recipe likes, recipe saves, recipe preparation time and recipe servings.

All icons were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
